- Created config.php to connect to db
- Looked into CSS frameworks as I had never used one before
- Tailwind CSS and Pico CSS look neat, I will stick with Pico for now
- Created the resgistration and login pages
- Made the required logic to have a user be able to register through the registration page (A lot more difficult than I thought it would be)
- I found a very useful tutorial [tutorial](https://youtu.be/BaEm2Qv14oU).

## Week of Jan 23rd

- Realized that the way that I started the project was not the best way to go about it so I decided to refactor/restart the project
- This time it adheres much more to the functional requirements
- Have a working admin page to log in
- Have a working browse page to view all the images

## Week of Jan 30th
- Not a lot of work done this week
- Restructured the way the db is set up to be more in line with class examples

## Week of Feb 6th
- Fixed querys to retrieve proper data
- Completed pagination for browse page
- Created all of the querys for the browse page
- Fixed favicon
- Still link the querys to the search selects
- Rating sort is not working for some reason

## Week of Feb 13th
- Completely changed the way that queries are made to the db. This made the page much much faster.
- 'Fixed' the sorting, it is not doing the paramenter binding
- Almost done for the php side, just need a few more things like the admin log in
